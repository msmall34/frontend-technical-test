# My process and Choices :

I started by changing the home, and adding a navigation betweeen the home, the users page, and the conversations page.  
- Then i created a lib to connect to the API  
- Then I created a users page (showing all users), and a conversation page (showing all conversations)
- Then I added a component to show all the messages within the selected conversation  
- Then a component to handle the send of new message in this selected conversation  
- I added also :
  - a component in charge to create a new conversation
  - an error manager/bouderies, 
  - some unit tests
