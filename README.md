# My process and Choices :

I started by changing the home, and adding a link to navigate to all conversations.
Then i created a lib to connect to the API
Then I created a conversation page to display all conversations
Then I added a component to show all the messages within the selected the conversation
Then a component to handle the send of new message this selected conversation
and finally i added a component in charge to create a new conversation


# To be done next :

- Add some tests
- Add an Error mananger to catch any error which would generate a "white page" and block the app in production and display a nice message instead
